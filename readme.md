# Covid-Thematic-Maps

In this lab I design web map application for COVID cases and rates in 2020. The first map is a choropleth map with the rates of covid in the country per county and the second map is a proportional map for covid cases around the country.

The data that was needed to complete this map came from the [2018 ACS 5 year estimates](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0100000US.050000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true) while the county boudary shapefile came from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html).

The primary function of this map is to see the covid rates in your area by hovering over an area and it will tell you the rates in those areas.
